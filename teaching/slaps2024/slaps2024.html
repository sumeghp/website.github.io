                <span class="bold-text">Course Description</span>:
                Symbolic logic presents an intriguing challenge in computer science: balancing the need to express
                complex ideas
                with the ability to solve problems efficiently. This course explores how we can create systems that are
                powerful
                enough to describe useful scenarios, yet still allow computers to reason about them effectively. We'll
                examine
                various approaches to this balance, learning how theorists and practitioners have developed ways to
                represent
                knowledge and automate reasoning. Without requiring any prior background in logic or advanced
                mathematics, this
                course offers a gentle yet rigorous introduction to deductive systems, propositional and predicate
                calculi, and
                higher-order logic. We will also learn about the applications of these formalisms to constraint solving,
                program
                verification, automated reasoning, and interactive theorem proving. The objectives of this course are
                to:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Develop a foundation in the core concepts and deductive systems of propositional logic, predicate
                    logic, and
                    higher-order logics, including their syntax, semantics, and proof techniques,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Gain knowledge of the practical applications of symbolic logic in a variety of domains, such as
                    constraint
                    solving, program verification, automated reasoning, and interactive theorem proving,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Understand the trade-off between expressiveness and algorithmic tractability in logical formalisms,
                    and the
                    importance of finding reasonable compromises between these conflicting goals,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understand the fundamental limitations of formal logic, reasoning, and computation, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Develop hands-on experience working with tools like SAT solvers and interactive theorem provers,
                    bridging the gap between theoretical reasoning and practical considerations. <br>
                    </li>
                    </ol>

            <p>
                This course builds upon concepts such as set theory, relations, and proofs covered in Quantitative
                Reasoning and
                Mathematical Thinking (FC-0306), Introduction to Computer Science (CS-1101/1102), and Discrete
                Mathematics
                (CS-1104). It also provides essential skills for analyzing and reasoning about the concepts covered in
                Data
                Structures (CS-1203), Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS-1205/1206), Theory of Computation (CS-1349/2349) Programming Language Design
                and
                Implementation (CS-1319). This course serves as a foundation for advanced electives in computer science
                including
                interactive theorem proving, model checking and verification, computational complexity theory, and
                Artificial
                Intelligence (CS-2322). This course overlaps with Symbolic Logic (PHI-1060/CS-2160).

        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Prerequisites</span>: First, the course will require a certain amount of
            mathematical maturity at least at the level
            of FC-0306, and preferably at the level of CS-1101/02. Second, functional knowledge of a programming language
                (preferably Python) is required for completing the assignments and projects in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Grading</span>: A serious student of a subject is not an idle spectator to a
                variety show but learns best by active
                involvement. This is particularly true of mathematical subjects. This course is structured to
                incentivise involvement through the following:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href="./scribing.html">Scribing</a>: Each student will be responsible for taking detailed notes
                    during the
                    lectures assigned to them and drafting them in LaTeX. This exercise encourages active listening and
                    helps
                    consolidate understanding of the material. It constitutes <span class="bold-text">10%</span> of the
                    grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <a href="./project.html">Course Project</a>: Students will undertake a project on constraint solving
                    (which
                    requires programming). This hands-on experience allows for practical application of course concepts
                    and
                    fosters deeper engagement with the subject matter covered in Module 3. The project may be done
                    either alone or
                    in pairs. Project topic needs to be approved by the instructor. It carries <span class="bold-text">20%</span> of the
                    grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Assignments: The course includes 10 problem sets. These are designed to
                    reinforce
                    lecture material and develop practical skills in applying theoretical concepts. They constitute
                    <span class="bold-text">40%</span> of
                    the grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Examination: Two in-class, closed-book, 1.5 hour examinations carry the remaining <span class="bold-text">30%</span> of
                    the grade.
                    Students are permitted to bring a single, two-sided "cheat sheet" of their own creation.
                    </li>
                    </ol>

            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold-text">Assignments</span>: Assignments will be available every Tuesday after class and will be due by 9am the following Monday. We aim to grade assignments in the same week. Please use <a href="turnitin.com">turnitin.com</a> to
                submit assignments. 
                No extensions will be granted except in the case of medical emergencies, proof of which must be emailed to the teaching assistant within 24 hours of the request.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="bold-text">Audit Requirements</span>: The audit grade for this course will be evaluated based only on 
                assignments and projects (students must complete at least 6 of the 10 assignments). Students auditing the course need not take the exams or meet the scribing requirements. Students are welcome to audit this course without a grade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="bold-text">Policies</span>:
                Students are expected to review and abide by Ashoka's Academic Integrity Policy (MyAshoka &rarr; Information and Documents &rarr; Office of Academic Affairs). Attendance is not mandated for
                this course,
                with two exceptions: (1) Each student will be assigned to scribe for one or more classes; attendance is
                required for
                the assigned classes. (2) All students are required to attend and actively participate in the discussion
                during
                Lecture 11 (October 1) and Course Project Presentations (November 28).
            </p>
